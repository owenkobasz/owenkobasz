<h2>Hi, I'm @owenkobasz</h2>

<p>I'm interested in technology that fosters human connection by helping us better understand ourselves, each other, and our place in the universe.</p>

<p>In 2025, I earned a Master’s in Computer and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania. Before that, I worked as an editor, curator, gallery director, marketing lead, bicycle courier, art handler, AV tech, snowboard instructor, and farmhand.</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree from St. John’s College in Santa Fe, NM, a “Great Books” school where students engage deeply with foundational texts and learn to think critically. I also studied urban planning at Temple University to better understand the lineage of our built environment and how data can shape its future.</p>
