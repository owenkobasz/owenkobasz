<h2>Hi, I'm @owenkobasz</h2>

<p>I’m interested in technology that fosters human connection by helping us better understand ourselves, each other, and the systems we inhabit.</p>

<p>I’m currently enrolled in a dual-degree Master’s program in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2025, I earned a Master’s in Computer and Information Technology from Penn, where my work has focused on algorithms, data systems, and applied AI.</p>

<p>Before transitioning fully into tech, I worked across editorial, cultural, and operational roles, including editor, curator, gallery director, marketing lead, bicycle courier, art handler, AV tech, snowboard instructor, and farmhand. Those experiences continue to shape how I think about systems, scale, and people.</p>

<p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree from St. John’s College in Santa Fe, NM, a “Great Books” program emphasizing close reading, rigorous discussion, and critical reasoning. I also studied urban planning at Temple University, developing an interest in how data, infrastructure, and policy shape the built environment.</p>
