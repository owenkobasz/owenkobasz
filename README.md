Hi, I'm @owenkobasz

I'm interested in technology that enables human connection by better understanding our selves, each other, and our place in the universe.

In 2025, I graduated with a Master in Computer and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania. Before that I've been an editor, curator, gallery director, marketing lead, bicycle courier, art handler, av tech, snowboard instructor, and farmhand. I recieved my Bachlors from the 'Great Books' school St. John's College in Santa Fe, NM, where students study source texts and learn to think critically about them. Before pursuing my masters, I studied urban planning at Temple College to better understand the liniage of our built enviornment.

<p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree from St. John’s College in Santa Fe, NM, a “Great Books” school where students engage deeply with foundational texts and learn to think critically. I also studied urban planning at Temple University to better understand the lineage of our built environment and how data can shape its future.</p>
